# TLSH-RS

This is a Rust port of Trend Micro Locality Sensitive Hash (TLSH) [[github]](https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh), [[website]](https://tlsh.org/) algorithm to compute a hash value of a byte stream. These generated hash values can then be used for similarity detection, data clustering or nearest neighbour search.
